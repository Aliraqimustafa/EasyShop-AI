Welcome to the EasyShop AI repository! This project aims to provide an AI-powered shopping assistant capable of helping users shop for products effectively. By leveraging modern artificial intelligence techniques, this system acts as a personal companion for users, assisting them in finding and purchasing products seamlessly.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users submit a message to the artificial intelligence system, specifying the product they want to buy and their payment preferences.

2. **AI Processing**: The AI processes the user's request and searches the database for relevant products. It utilizes advanced algorithms to match user preferences with suitable products.

3. **Product Recommendations**: The system provides the user with a list of recommended products based on their request. Each product comes with a source link, such as `amazon.com/product/easyshop-ai`, to facilitate easy purchasing.

4. **Integration with Stores**: This code can be integrated into existing online stores by linking it to the store's database. Store owners can leverage this technology to attract more customers, especially those who may struggle with traditional search methods.
